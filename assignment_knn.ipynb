For each value of $k$, compute the mean squared error and print a scatterplot showing the test value plotted against the predicted value. What patterns do you notice as you increase $k$?\n",

    "8. OK, do steps 5 through 7 again, but use all of the variables (except `time`). Which model has a lower Sum of Squared Error? Which would you prefer to use in practice, if you had to predict `DEATH_EVENT`s? If you play with the selection of variables, how much does the SSE change for your fitted model on the test data? Are more variables always better? Explain your findings."
